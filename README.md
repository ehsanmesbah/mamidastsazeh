Source Code for a small social media website for Farsi speaking users, using .netcore, EFcore, Razor, bootstrap, MVC pattern ....` 
The code is written by me on 2019 and used .net core 3.1. 
The site is also include Instagram Posts which was published by my wife on https://instagram.com/mamidastsazeh page. I used Facebook API to download these posts from Instagram.
I have published the source code of an application to use Facebook API on another repository.
This web site include serveral features like sending SMS for registration, allowing users to upload images and videos about thier hadicrafts. 
Using tools like FFMPEG to compress videos. The site is run and live under the address of https://mamidastsazeh.com .
You should be careful if you want use this code with DB other than MSSQL because some feature of lazy loading fails!
You should update appsetting.json by your environment configuration.
